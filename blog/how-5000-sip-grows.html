<h1>How ₹5,000 Monthly SIP Grows Over Time</h1>

<p>Many investors underestimate how powerful a small monthly SIP can become over long periods. Let us analyze how a ₹5,000 monthly SIP grows at an average annual return of 12%.</p>

<h2>Basic Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monthly SIP: ₹5,000</li>
<li>Annual Return: 12%</li>
<li>Compounding: Monthly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Growth After 10 Years</h2>
<ul>
<li>Total Investment = ₹6,00,000</li>
<li>Estimated Value ≈ ₹11,61,000</li>
<li>Profit ≈ ₹5,61,000</li>
</ul>

<p>In 10 years, your money almost doubles due to compounding.</p>

<h2>Growth After 20 Years</h2>
<ul>
<li>Total Investment = ₹12,00,000</li>
<li>Estimated Value ≈ ₹49,00,000</li>
<li>Profit ≈ ₹37,00,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice how growth accelerates significantly in the second decade.</p>

<h2>Growth After 30 Years</h2>
<ul>
<li>Total Investment = ₹18,00,000</li>
<li>Estimated Value ≈ ₹1,76,00,000</li>
<li>Profit ≈ ₹1,58,00,000</li>
</ul>

<p>This is exponential growth. The last 10 years create the highest wealth impact.</p>

<h2>Why Does Growth Increase So Fast?</h2>
<p>The longer the investment period, the more your returns generate additional returns. Compounding becomes stronger with time.</p>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time matters more than amount.</li>
<li>Starting early reduces financial pressure later.</li>
<li>Long-term consistency beats short-term timing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What If Return Is Lower?</h2>
<p>If average return is 10% instead of 12%, the final corpus will be lower, but long-term investing still creates significant wealth.</p>

<h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
<p>A ₹5,000 monthly SIP may look small today, but over 25–30 years it can create substantial wealth. The key factor is consistency and patience.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<h3>1. Is 12% return guaranteed?</h3>
<p>No. Mutual fund returns depend on market performance.</p>

<h3>2. Can I increase SIP amount later?</h3>
<p>Yes. Step-up SIP increases investment annually and accelerates growth.</p>

<h3>3. Is ₹5,000 enough to start?</h3>
<p>Yes. Starting small is better than delaying investment.</p>

<h3>4. What happens if I miss a SIP?</h3>
<p>Missing occasional installments may reduce total returns but does not cancel the investment.</p>

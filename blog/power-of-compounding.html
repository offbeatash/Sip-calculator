<h1>Power of Compounding Explained with Simple Examples</h1>

<p>The power of compounding is the process where your investment earns returns, and those returns also start earning returns. Over time, this creates exponential growth.</p>

<h2>What is Compounding?</h2>
<p>Compounding means earning returns on both your original investment (principal) and on previously earned returns.</p>

<h3>Compounding Formula</h3>
<p><strong>Future Value = P × (1 + r)<sup>t</sup></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>P = Principal amount</li>
<li>r = Annual return rate</li>
<li>t = Time in years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simple Example</h2>
<p>If you invest ₹1,00,000 at 12% annual return:</p>

<ul>
<li>After 1 year → ₹1,12,000</li>
<li>After 2 years → ₹1,25,440</li>
<li>After 10 years → ₹3,10,585</li>
<li>After 20 years → ₹9,64,629</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice how growth accelerates over time.</p>

<h2>Why Time is More Important Than Amount</h2>

<p>Consider two investors:</p>

<h3>Investor A</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starts at age 25</li>
<li>Invests ₹5,000/month for 10 years</li>
<li>Stops investing after 35</li>
</ul>

<h3>Investor B</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starts at age 35</li>
<li>Invests ₹5,000/month for 20 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though Investor B invests more money overall, Investor A often ends up with higher wealth because of longer compounding duration.</p>

<h2>Compounding with SIP Example</h2>

<p>₹5,000 monthly SIP for 25 years at 12% return:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total Investment = ₹15,00,000</li>
<li>Estimated Value ≈ ₹84,00,000</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the power of compounding combined with disciplined investing.</p>

<h2>Rule of 72</h2>

<p>To estimate how fast money doubles:</p>
<p><strong>72 ÷ interest rate = years to double</strong></p>

<p>At 12% return:</p>
<p>72 ÷ 12 = 6 years to double your money.</p>

<h2>Why Compounding Favors Early Investors</h2>

<ul>
<li>More time in market</li>
<li>Higher exponential growth</li>
<li>Lower pressure to invest large sums</li>
<li>Better risk management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes That Reduce Compounding</h2>

<ul>
<li>Stopping investments early</li>
<li>Frequent withdrawals</li>
<li>Trying to time the market</li>
<li>Investing without long-term plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Conclusion</h2>

<p>Compounding is the most powerful tool in long-term investing. The earlier you start, the greater your wealth potential. Time in the market is more important than timing the market.</p>
